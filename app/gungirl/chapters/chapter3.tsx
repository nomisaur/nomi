        You stood outside your parents home looking into the woods beyond. You
        lived on the threshhold of a small community of houses spread out among
        the tall coastal trees. To the East things became more urban as the land
        became flatter and closer to the bay. To the West was an expanse of
        trees and mist and hills that rose higher up until they peaked and then
        fell again into the vast Pacific Ocean.

        You were not aloud past the treeline, and yet there you stood carefully
        considering whether or not to become a rule-breaker. This might be the
        first rule that you would be consciously breaking. You looked back
        towards your home. The more you stared at it the more it narrowed in on
        you like it wanted to swallow you.
