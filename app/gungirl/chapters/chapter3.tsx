        You stood outside your parents home looking into the woods beyond. You
        lived on the threshhold of a small community of houses spread out among
        the tall coastal trees. To the north was the mineral quarry where your
        father worked. To the South and to the East were houses that continued
        in those directions becoming more urban as the land became flatter and
        closer to the bay. To the west was an expanse of trees and mist and
        hills that rose higher up until they peaked and then fell again into the
        vast Pacific Ocean.
